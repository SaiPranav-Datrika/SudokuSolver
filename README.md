# SudokuSolver

The goal of the project is to solve the sudoku puzzle game by implementing A* search algorithm .We must be writing the source code using the A* algorithm.The performance of the algorithms and heuristic functions by running the program for a heuristic function.

The objective of the sudoku game is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.The problem of solving a Sudoku puzzle can be modeled as a search problem, where the goal is to find a valid assignment of numbers to the empty cells of the grid. The A* search algorithm can be used to efficiently solve the Sudoku puzzle problem by exploring the search space in a heuristic-driven way.
